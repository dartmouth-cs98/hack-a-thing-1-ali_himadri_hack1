### Ali and Himadri Hack-a-Thing1

### Short description of what you attempted to build
We attempted to build an alexa skill that uses the Spotify Web Api. We thought it may be cool to have an alexa skill that lets you play a certain song based on the API data. With this, we aimed to explore the developer environment for making an alexa skill and also get more familiar with the spotify API and how to read and use API documentation in general.
### Who did what (if you worked with someone else)
We both worked on research and reading online resources about how similar projects are built. Together, we set up the Amazon ASK CLI developer console through Himadri's account and registered a spotify application. We then worked through the setup together. We got to a point where on the Alexa app we could view the skill and log in with the spotify account. Then we encountered some errors when beginning to access the data and Himadri worked more on fixing that. Ali at this point focused on getting a separate app working with the Spotify API through the online tutorial.
